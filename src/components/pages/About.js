            My name is Dan, aka ToiletTakos or in some cases while gaming, Judy Hopps. I’m married to my 
            awesome wife and I’m a new dad to a cool little guy. We have two crazy dogs; one golden retriever and 
            one super mix who also looks like a golden. We also have two enormous cats; one grey and white with a 
            moustache and the other is orange. <br />
            <br />
            My main interest is gaming. I can usually be found playing an assortment of games from Hell Let Loose 
            to Halo to Minecraft and Sea of Thieves. When it comes to sports, Hockey, Football and a little F1 are my 
            favorites. The Florida Panthers are my team when it comes to hockey. When it comes to Football, my 
            club team is Chelsea, while England and Sweden are my picks for International. I am an avid coffee 
            addict (though it seems like everyone is these days!) but I started a lot younger than most at age 13. <br />
            <br />
            Currently, I work in the hospitality and service industry at a banquet hall. My job is a little confusing to 
            the outside viewer because I can be seen in almost every department from kitchen, inventory, 
            accounting and management. I’ve always wanted to learn to code and use that to better my abilities in 
            the online world.
